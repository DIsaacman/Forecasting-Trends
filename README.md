## When the search traffic declines, so does the stock price. It also appears that the long term trend in the close price is increasing even though the traffic is not consistently increasing and is remaining reasonably steady.




 According to the data, there is a slight negative correlation between stock volatility and search trends, which may indicate that higher search traffic will slightly decrease the stock volatility.




## The peak revenue days are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays
